# Animated Orbital Asteroid, Planet, and Moon Calculator Using Kepler's Ellipse Equations and Pyastronomy (AOAPMCUKEEP) (OAPMC - For short)

## Overview
Welcome to the Orbital Asteroid and Planet Calculator (OAPMC), a Python code designed for calculating and visualizing the orbits of various celestial bodies in 3D, including planets and asteroids, and moons in 3D. This project utilizes real astronomical data from the year 2000 to generate accurate representations of orbital paths, making it an excellent, as well as a fun resource for educational purposes, amateur astronomers, and anyone interested in celestial and orbital mechanics.

## Features
- **3D Orbit Visualization**: Plots the orbits of planets and asteroids in a three-dimensional space (3D), providing a realistic view of their trajectories.
- **Custom Data Input**: Supports input from CSV files, allowing users to visualize orbits based on custom datasets.
- **Animation Support**: Includes functionality to animate the movement of celestial bodies along their orbits.
- **Zoom and Focus**: Offers features to zoom in on specific regions of the plot for detailed examination.
- **Large Datasets**: This project also holds very large datasets containing the Keplerian Element information on most or hopefuly all Planets, Moons and asteroids currently orbiting in our solar system.

## Final File
The main script of the project is `v0.2/objects-orbit-3D-CSV-all-asteroids.py`, which contains the core functionality for orbit calculations and 3D plotting.
